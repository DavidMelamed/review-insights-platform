```

## Phase 5: SaaS Platform (Week 5)

### 5.1 Backend API
```bash
# API development
./claude-flow swarm "Build REST API with authentication, subscription management, job queuing, and webhook notifications" --strategy development --mode centralized --max-agents 5 --monitor

# Database design
./claude-flow sparc run architect "Design PostgreSQL schema for multi-tenant SaaS with reviews, reports, users, and subscriptions"
```

### 5.2 Frontend Dashboard
```bash
# React dashboard
./claude-flow swarm "Create Next.js dashboard with report builder, brand customization, competitor management, and analytics" --strategy development --mode distributed --max-agents 6 --parallel
```

## Phase 6: Integration & Testing (Week 6)

### 6.1 LLM Prompt Generator
```bash
# Prompt engineering
./claude-flow sparc run innovator "Build LLM prompt generator that creates context-rich prompts from review insights for copywriting, product development, and marketing"
```

### 6.2 Testing & Deployment
```bash
# Comprehensive testing
./claude-flow swarm "Create end-to-end testing suite with API tests, integration tests, and UI tests using Jest, Playwright, and Cypress" --strategy testing --mode centralized --monitor

# Deployment setup
./claude-flow sparc run architect "Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, Docker deployment, and Kubernetes orchestration"
```

## Key Commands for Daily Development

### Start Development Environment
```bash
# Start the full system with monitoring
./claude-flow start --ui --port 3000

# Monitor active tasks
./claude-flow monitor
```

### Quick Task Execution
```bash
# Quick feature development
./claude-flow sparc "Add new review source integration"

# Debug issues
./claude-flow sparc run debugger "Fix review parsing errors"

# Code review
./claude-flow sparc run reviewer "Review security of API endpoints"
```

### Memory Management
```bash
# Store important decisions
./claude-flow memory store "api_keys" "DataForSEO key configuration"

# Retrieve stored data
./claude-flow memory get "system_design"

# Export project memory
./claude-flow memory export project_knowledge.json
```

## Monitoring Progress
```bash
# Check system status
./claude-flow status

# View active agents
./claude-flow agent list

# Monitor task queue
./claude-flow task list
```

## Notes
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- Use memory to maintain context across sessions
- Leverage parallel execution for independent tasks
- Monitor system resources during heavy operations
- Export memory periodically for backup
